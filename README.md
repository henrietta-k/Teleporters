# Teleporters

In order to make campus more accessible, school administrators are planning on building a network of tunnels and teleporters between campus buildings that connect the whole campus together. While a tunnel only connects two buildings, teleporters can connect to any other teleporter on campus. However, building these tunnels and teleporters come at a cost.
This solver takes in the cost of the tunnels and teleporters and computes the minimum cost for the entire network to be built across campus, that is, the cost of its minimum spanning tree.
